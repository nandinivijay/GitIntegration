Constructor in Java is used to initialize the object at the time of its creation.
It is syntactically similar to the method.
Constructors do not have any explicit return type.
If we do not define a constructor explicitly, them java provides  a default constructor where all the instance variables are initialized
to it's default value.
There are three types of constructores.
(i) Default constructor
(ii) No-argument constructor
(iii) Parameterized Constructor.
